Krishi Sahayak is an **AI-powered mobile application & chatbot** that provides farmers with **personalized crop advisory, soil health insights, weather forecasts, pest/disease alerts, and marketplace access.**  
It aims to **empower small & marginal farmers** (who form 86% of India’s farming community) with localized, easy-to-use, multilingual technology.  

---

## 🚜 Problem ?

- **86% of Indian farmers are small/marginal** (NABARD 2022)  
- Farmers rely on **guesswork/local advice → low yield & high costs**  
- **Overuse of chemicals → soil degradation & environmental harm**  
- **Limited market access, digital barriers, and language issues**  
- Lack of **personalized, AI-driven advisory tools**  

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution  

A **multilingual, AI-powered mobile app** that offers:  
- ✅ Personalized crop & soil advisory (AI/ML-driven)  
- ✅ Pest & disease detection via **image uploads**  
- ✅ Real-time **weather & market alerts**  
- ✅ Marketplace for inputs (seeds, fertilizers) & selling produce  
- ✅ Voice support for low-literate farmers  
- ✅ Digital payments & logistics integration  
- ✅ Community forums for farmer learning & expert support  

---

## 🌾 Impact  

- 📈 **20–30% higher yield** through scientific advisory  
- 💰 Reduced input costs (fertilizer, pesticide, water)  
- 🛒 Better income via direct market access & fair pricing  
- 🌍 Sustainable practices: soil & water conservation, reduced chemical overuse  
- 🧑‍🌾 Empowered small & marginal farmers with localized tech

## 🏗️ Architecture  

### Tech Stack  
- **Frontend (Mobile):** Flutter / Kotlin (with Firebase notifications)  
- **Backend:** Node.js (APIs & Logic), Firebase (Auth & Storage), MongoDB (Database)  
- **AI/ML:** TensorFlow (ML models), Python + OpenCV (image processing)  
- **Integrations:**  
  - OpenWeatherMap (weather data)  
  - Agmarknet (market prices)  
  - Soil Health Card DB (fertilizer guidance)  
  - EdgeTTS (text-to-speech)
